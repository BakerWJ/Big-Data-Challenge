# STEM Fellowship Big Data Challenge

In February of 2020, the team of Alexander Zhuang, Jason Xiong, Nathan Kim, and Baker Jackson submitted the research paper titled "Predicting Hurricane Frequency and Intensity Using Ocean Data and Boosting Algorithms" to the Big Data Challenge.

## Research

Our paper used datasets from NOAA and NCAR that included ocean temperature, wind shear, and pressure data. We cleaned and compiled these datasets and used XGBoost classification and regression models to predict the number of hurricanes in the coming months and their Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale. Using this model, we were able to plot the ocean areas that contributed the most to our model.

## Results

Our paper was graded as one of the top 5 in Canada and we were invited to the Eastern Canada Big Data Day. There, we presented our findings to a panel of PhDs and were awarded the top prize of the Let's Talk Science Analytics Talent Award. Our paper is currently in the proccess of being published by the STEM Fellowship Journal.
